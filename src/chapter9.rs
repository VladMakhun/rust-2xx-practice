//1. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Methods are similar to functions: Declare with fn, have parameters and a return value. Unlike functions, methods are defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait object), and their first parameter is always self, which represents the instance of the struct the method is being called on.

struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 { 
        self.width * self.height 
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 };

    assert_eq!(rect1.area(), 1500);

    println!("Success!");
}

//2. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ self will take the ownership of current struct instance, however, &self will only borrow a reference from the instance.

#[derive(Debug)]
struct TrafficLight {
    color: String,
}

impl TrafficLight {
    pub fn show_state(&self) { 
        println!("the current state is {}", self.color); 
    }
}

fn main() {
    let light = TrafficLight{
        color: "red".to_owned(),
    };
    // Don't take the ownership of `light` here.
    light.show_state();
    // ... Otherwise, there will be an error below
    println!("{:?}", light);
}

//3. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ The &self is actually short for self: &Self. Within an impl block, the type Self is an alias for the type that the impl block is for. Methods must have a parameter named self of type Self for their first parameter, so Rust lets you abbreviate this with only the name self in the first parameter spot.

struct TrafficLight {
    color: String,
}

impl TrafficLight {
    pub fn show_state(&self) { 
        println!("the current state is {}", self.color);
    }

    pub fn change_state(&mut self) { 
        self.color = "green".to_string();
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!("Success!");
}

//4. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ All functions defined within an impl block are called associated functions because theyâ€™re associated with the type named after the impl. We can define associated functions that donâ€™t have self as their first parameter (and thus are not methods) because they donâ€™t need an instance of the type to work with.

#[derive(Debug)]
struct TrafficLight {
    color: String,
}

impl TrafficLight {
    
    pub fn new() -> Self { 
        Self {
            color: "red".to_string(), 
        }
    }

    pub fn get_state(&self) -> &str {
        &self.color
    }
}

fn main() {
    let light = TrafficLight::new();
    assert_eq!(light.get_state(), "red");

    println!("Success!");
}

//5. ðŸŒŸ Each struct is allowed to have multiple impl blocks.

struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!("Success!");
}

//6. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ We can also implement methods for enums.

#[derive(Debug)]
enum TrafficLightColor {
    Red,
    Yellow,
    Green,
}

impl TrafficLightColor {
    pub fn color(&self) -> &str {
        match self {
            TrafficLightColor::Red => "red",
            TrafficLightColor::Yellow => "yellow",
            TrafficLightColor::Green => "green",
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let c = TrafficLightColor::Yellow;

    assert_eq!(c.color(), "yellow");

    println!("{:?}", c);
}
